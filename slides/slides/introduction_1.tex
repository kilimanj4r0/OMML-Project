    \begin{itemize}
        \item In SGD, mini-batches are used for gradient computation.
        \item These mini-batches introduce randomness, leading to high-variance gradient estimates.
        \item Gradient clipping helps stabilize training by preventing extreme updates caused by these fluctuations.
